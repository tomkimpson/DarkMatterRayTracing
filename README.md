# Light Ray Tracing in Kerr Spacetime

This code calculates the trajectory of light (ray - geometrical optics) on a background Kerr spacetime.

Whilst typical ray tracing typically integrates the ray *backwards* in time, for this code we instead integrate *forwards*.

The code solves a set of ODEs numerically. We use a Hamiltonian formulation as described in [Pu et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02063). 


## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

This code is written in FORTRAN with a [gfortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran) compiler. **Other compilers have not been tested.** The gfortran installation binaries can be found [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinariels), although typically gfortran comes pre-installed on most Linux/Unix systems. If you have [Homebew](https://brew.sh/) installed on OSX, you can simply run 


```
brew install gcc
```

### Starting steps
After [cloning the repo](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository), the first thing to do is to set the path to the output files that the code will produce.
This can be done by setting the environment variable as

```
echo 'export RayTracingDir="/Users/tomkimpson/Data/RayTracing/"' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Just change the path `Users/tomkimpson/Data/RayTracing/` to some appropriate local path. 

You can check the environemnt variable has been added to `bash_profile` by either `env` or `vim ~/.bashprofile`


The code should then run as is, out of the box. Try

```
run.py
```
to compile and run the code. Once you have checked that everything is running OK, you can then start playing. The code structure (modukes, subroutines etc.) is outlined below.


If making edits to the code, try to keep to the [FORTRAN Style Guide](https://www.fortran90.org/src/best-practices.html)

## Structure

### src
`parameters.f` defines all the system parameters. That is, anything that needs changing (e.g. BH mass, BH spin) can be modified in this module

`constants.f` is for calculations with those parameters for use later in the code. It can effectively be ignored - no changes should be necessary to this file

`main.f` is where the code program is run from. After setting up the initial conditions (`initial_conditions.f`) it then goes on to integrate the equations and save the output (`integration.f') 

`tensors.f` contains some useful subroutines for calculating e.g. metric, vector magnitudes etc.


A python wrapper has been provided to compile and run the code, `run.py`. We use a `-O3` optimization. [See the docs](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html) for discussion on the optimization flags

###tools

`PlotRays.py' does what is says on the tin. Can be switched between 3d and 2d by changing the opening `d' parameter


## Numerical Method
We integrate the equations using a Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg algorithm with adaptive stepsize. See [Press et al.](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=141273)


### Accuracy tests
When integrating numerically, an important consideration is the accuracy of the method. We can assess this by independelty evaluating the conserved quantities $E,L,Q$ independently.



## ToDO()

* Add E/L/Q/H + total error checks which can be turned on/off
* Sort out energy/frequency etc
* Sort out setting initial direction. Maybe bin psr + tetrad for now until everything else is working
